2 Processes
Blocked 3 times each.
Run for 4000 (Mean * 2)
Both processes run alonside each other, not by waiting for one to complete before starting the next one. Both processes were blocked at the same times: 500/1000/1500

5 Processes
Blocked 3 times (each), same as in case of 2 processes.
Run for 10000 (5 processes * mean of 2000), reaching the max. allowed time but the simulation was not bound by it, as it finished just as the time run out.
Looks like the processes run in pairs (first 0&1, when that pair is done 2&3, and when those two are done - 4). If there were 6 processes then both 4&5 would be cut right in the middle of its execution.


10 Processes
Runs for the allowed max (10000)
Blocked up to 3 times. (The completed ones 3 times, the ones that were cut short - 2 or 1 blocks). It may be that if there was even a 1ms more time both of the 3rd pair would be on 2 blocks. The later ones didnt even start running.
Processes again run in pairs.
